<h2>Too Long, Didn’t Read:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The world of data is chaotic and a lot of research is not reproducible due to non-standardized,
improper ways of handling and publishing data.</li>
<li>Be part of the solution and stick to a data management plan early on in your research to force
you to think about gathering, handling, publishing, licensing, and storing data that you, your
peers, and the broad public can use for decades to come.</li>
<li>Open science encompasses much more than just sharing data! Use open-source software where
possible, publish data in line with the FAIR principles, be transparent about your analysis so
others can reproduce it, and most importantly, explain in plain concise language what you did
with your data (yes, this means a lot of comments in your code but it is worth it!)</li>
</ul>

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the second week of my PhD, I attended a summer school on research data management<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (hereafter
RDM) hosted by ETH Zurich and it really helped me to think about the bigger picture of using data in
research. The summer school covered various topics from searching data online to wrangling it and
finally publishing it under open access. This post is much too short for an exhaustive elaboration
on each step, so I will only focus on the key messages and may elaborate in later posts.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-reproducibility-crisis" class="section level2">
<h2>The Reproducibility Crisis</h2>
<p>To exemplify the importance of and need for proper research data management may be apparent to
anyone who tried to re-use data or code from other people. The magnitude of this issue was much
larger than I expected. I only knew of the reproducibility crisis in psychological research.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>However, there is a serious crisis across all fields. In a 1’500 participants study, 90% said that
there is a significant (58%) or slight (38%) reproducibility crisis in science.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I took it as a
serious note to my own coding when reading that 40% of scientists in my field of earth and
environmental science failed to reproduce their own results! So, we better stick to the Gold
Standard of full replication of results<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and do not belong to the 93%<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> that claim their data
is available on request but never make it available…</p>
<p>It is no big surprise that more and more funders request a data management plan (DMP) when writing
research proposals. Following coherent RDM principles will help to resolve this crisis and bring
clear advantages for you as a researcher, for the peers you are collaborating with, and for the
general public which often funds your work. You may gain career recognition, citations and attract
new collaborations whilst your peers can benefit from using your work for their research, for
teaching, for new insights that you might have missed, etc. And the general public will gain
much-needed trust in science, can independently validate your work, and even participate as citizen
scientists.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data-life-cycle" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data Life Cycle</h2>
<p>The summer school started with the presentation of a data life cycle which consists of the following
steps (see Foster Open Science for a visualization<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Defining a research question</li>
<li>Creating a data management plan</li>
<li>Collecting, storing, and documenting data</li>
<li>Evaluating and selecting data of interest</li>
<li>Processing, analyzing, and interpreting data</li>
<li>Publishing</li>
<li>Preserving</li>
<li>Verifying and re-use</li>
<li>(…jumping back to “1. Defining a research question”)</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, this life cycle is much more exhaustive than just accessing and re-using data for your
own work. It starts from your first idea for what data might be useful to preserving your final data
(that includes manuscripts and code) in a reusable matter for possibly multiple decades. Thus, it is
crucial for the beginning of any project, that there is a clear strategy - or data management plan -
in place which prepares, tracks, and ensures the principles of proper RDM.</p>
<p>Following the recommendation of the SNSF, a DMP should cover the four main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: What data will be collected in what way are you going to do and document it?</li>
<li>Ethics, legal and security issues: How will you handle ethical issues, safely store sensitive
data and handle copyright issues?</li>
<li>Data Storage and Preservation: How and where do you share the data (repositories, research
collections, etc.), and how do you ensure being in line with FAIR principles and security
requirements?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="open-science" class="section level2">
<h2>Open Science</h2>
<p>There is various confusing terminology out there when it comes to defining open science. Following
the definition by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), open science “is the umbrella term
for all efforts aimed at achieving more openness in science and the necessary paradigm shift”.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Foster Open Science defined the following categories of open science:<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Open Notebooks</li>
<li>Open Data</li>
<li>Open Peer Review</li>
<li>Open Access</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>Scientific Social Networks</li>
<li>Citizen Science</li>
<li>Open Educational Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of open data out there but unfortunately, most of it is just not useable in a quick
and easy way. Various reasons that cause such issues of non-reproducibility can be avoided following
the FAIR principles.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> These principles compromise simple intuitive rules that should be
considered when aiming at sharing data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>F</strong> indable: Use DOIs, write well-documented metadata and data, index work in search engines</li>
<li><strong>A</strong> ccessible: When found, at least the (well-documented) metadata should be available</li>
<li><strong>I</strong> nteroperable: Use file types that are useable by any machine/software and that can be
potentially read by humans (e.g., text files can be read, binary files not)</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> reusable: Metadata fully describes data, and includes a suitable license that meets the
standards of your scientific communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, note that these FAIR principles do not directly require that the data is open. If your
research field and funding body allow, you can publish your data in a publicly accessible repository
with a suitable open source license.</p>
</div>
<div id="remarks" class="section level2">
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The topic of RDM is much broader than what can be depicted in a single post (even an entire summer
school was barely enough to dive deep into all the topics). Here is a list of other topics that are
part of RDM which have not been covered here :</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling of sensitive data: In fields where personal data is collected, e.g. in medical
research, a multitude of additional aspects have to be considered. When doing such research, you
should be aware of basic ethical principles as declared by Nuremberg Code in 1947. Also when
considering open access and open data, you should clarify with funders and the legal department
of your university what rules and regulations apply.</li>
<li>Coding best practices: We had a great introduction to good coding practices which I cannot
elaborate in detail here. Keywords: Using open software, using open file formats, using
containers to create environments for reproducibility, learning how to use git and set up a
sensible directory for your files, and much more.</li>
<li>Where to get help: Check in with the IT, legal, and publishing department of your institution.
They should be able to help you out in conducting open science and if not - tell them that they
should get engaged in it!</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading these lines! I am fairly inexperienced with blogging and am happy about
any comments and constructive critique!</p>
