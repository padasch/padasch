ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pascal!

Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate at ETH ZÃ¼rich working at the intersection of ecology and data science, where I explore how forests respond to stress and how we can detect resilience (or decline) through large [time series data](https://github.com/padasch/tree_mortality_french_nfi).

ðŸŒ³ Much of my work blends ecological insights with machine learning and process-based modelling - from simulating [photosynthesis](https://github.com/padasch/thermacc) and the global carbon cycle to teaching [leaf thermal dynamics]([url](https://padasch.github.io/leaf_energy_balance_tutorial/)), [digital soil mapping](https://padasch.github.io/tutorial_digital_soil_mapping/), and [big data in environmental sciences](https://padasch.github.io/agds/). Iâ€™m especially interested in making methods transparent, accessible, and reproducible, so check out my various projects!

ðŸ’¡ I also have a Masterâ€™s degree in Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics from ETH Zurich, and Iâ€™m passionate about applying science beyond academia: from environmental management in the private sector to performing life cycle analysis for bicycle projects.

ðŸ“« Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re excited about turning ecological data into real-world environmental solutions - whether through forest resilience, carbon modeling, or sustainable innovation built with code.
