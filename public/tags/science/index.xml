      <description>Too Long, Didnâ€™t Read  Scientific conferences are for meeting people - use that opportunity! Asking questions as a fresh PhD is intimidating but not a reason to hold back. Try to get into a private conversation if you do not feel comfortable asking after a talk. Have a goal in mind of what you want to get out of the conference - are there any people you want to talk to about a specific question?</description>

      <description>Too Long, Didnâ€™t Read:  The world of data is chaotic and a lot of research is not reproducible due to non-standardized, improper ways of handling and publishing data. Be part of the solution and stick to a data management plan early on in your research to force you to think about gathering, handling, publishing, licensing, and storing data that you, your peers, and the broad public can use for decades to come.</description>
